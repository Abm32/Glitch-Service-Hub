 This is a solution proposed for poverty/unemployment sector under sustainable development goals.
 
 Poverty and unemployment has affected many around us . The only way to overcome this crisis is to reach out to the people that actually needs job opportunites. People who works as plumbers, electricians, mechanics has a hard time finding jobs and for the person who needs services from the same people have to go looking around for their contacts which is time consuming.

 So our team has come to a solution to eradicate poverty and unemployment to a certain level. Our proposal is to make a website which can connect both the consumer and the service provider .The websites basic work is to connect the consumer with the service provider with a request uploaded to the site with the help of an algorithm, then find the nearest service provider who can deliver the job as per the request.
